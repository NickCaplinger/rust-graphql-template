# Rust GraphQL Template

The goal of this repository is to provide a template project that is both accessible to newcomers and useful for those experienced with Rust and GraphQL.

If you are completely new to Rust, you should probably read the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) first.

If you are completely new to GraphQL, you should read a little bit about it on the [official GraphQL website](https://graphql.org/learn/).

If you are new to using GraphQL and Rust together, you might want to read [the documentation](https://async-graphql.github.io/) for the GraphQL dependency that we'll be using, [async-graphql](https://crates.io/crates/async-graphql). [juniper](https://crates.io/crates/juniper) is a viable alternative, but we won't be using that here.
